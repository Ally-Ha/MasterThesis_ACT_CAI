However, it could be improved by: 1) Normalizing that having worries is a common human experience (acceptance), 2) Gently noting the difference between having worried thoughts and being controlled by them (defusion), 3) Inviting curiosity about the worry rather than trying to eliminate it."},

Those worried thoughts can feel very demanding of our attention. I'm wondering if we could try something different: rather than fighting these worries or believing we need to solve them all right now, what if we just noticed them together? What's it like for you right now, in this moment, as you describe this? And underneath all these future concerns, what do you really care about that makes this feel so important?"}
